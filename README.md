# MiddleEnglishFlashCards
A deck of 200 Middle English flashcards containing the Middle English word, the Modern English translation, and the source. Allows you to type your translation, click a button to show the answer if you're stuck, and will automatically move through the deck of flashcards on correct submission.

The top buttons allow you to filter the deck based on which kind of words you want to see appear.  As of now, only 1 filter is supported.  Just click on the type of words you wish to see, and the next card that appears will be from that deck.  Refresh the page to either go back to the full deck of cards or to select a different deck.
