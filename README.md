# MiddleEnglishFlashCards
A deck of 200 Middle English flashcards containing the Middle English word, the Modern English translation, and the source. Allows you to type your translation, click a button to show the answer if you're stuck, and will automatically move through the deck of flashcards on correct submission.

While the default state contains all 200 words, the top buttons allow you to filter the deck based on which kind of words you want to see appear. Just click on the type of words you wish to see, and the card will change to match selected deck.  Refresh the page to go back to its default state of all 200 words.
